## Hello World

I'm learning Flutter, and this is one of my first Hello World Flutter apps.

Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is a UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

**Building a user interface with Flutter is so easy and productive that even a Hello World app can have multiple screens, menu items, buttons, and actions instead of just writing "Hello, World!" on the screen!**

## Getting Started

1. If you don't have the Flutter SDK installed, please visit the official [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) website.

2. Fetch the latest source code from the main branch.

``` 
git clone https://github.com/TechAurelian/hello_world_colors.git
```

3. Run the app with Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. Or the command line.

``` 
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
