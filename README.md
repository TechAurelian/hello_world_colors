## Hello World

I'm learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and this is one of my first Hello World Flutter apps.

Hello World apps are pretty famous, even if all they usually do is write "Hello, World!" on the screen. When learning a new programming language or platform, starting with such a simple program has become a tradition.

Flutter is a UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
